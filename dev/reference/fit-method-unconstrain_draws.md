# Transform all parameter draws to the unconstrained scale

The `$unconstrain_draws()` method transforms all parameter draws to the
unconstrained scale. The method returns a list for each chain,
containing the parameter values from each iteration on the unconstrained
scale. If called with no arguments, then the draws within the fit object
are unconstrained. Alternatively, either an existing draws object or a
character vector of paths to CSV files can be passed.

## Usage

``` r
unconstrain_draws(
  files = NULL,
  draws = NULL,
  format = getOption("cmdstanr_draws_format", "draws_array"),
  inc_warmup = FALSE
)
```

## Arguments

- files:

  (character vector) The paths to the CmdStan CSV files. These can be
  files generated by running CmdStanR or running CmdStan directly.

- draws:

  A `posterior::draws_*` object.

- format:

  (string) The format of the returned draws. Must be a valid format from
  the posterior package.

- inc_warmup:

  (logical) Should warmup draws be included? Defaults to `FALSE`.

fit_mcmc <- cmdstanr_example("logistic", method = "sample", force_recompile = TRUE)

# Unconstrain all internal draws
unconstrained_internal_draws <- fit_mcmc$unconstrain_draws()

# Unconstrain external CmdStan CSV files
unconstrained_csv <- fit_mcmc$unconstrain_draws(files = fit_mcmc$output_files())

# Unconstrain existing draws object
unconstrained_draws <- fit_mcmc$unconstrain_draws(draws = fit_mcmc$draws())
# }
