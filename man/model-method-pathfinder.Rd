\arguments{
\item{data}{(multiple options) The data to use for the variables specified in
the data block of the Stan program. One of the following:
\itemize{
\item A named list of \R objects with the names corresponding to variables
declared in the data block of the Stan program. Internally this list is
then written to JSON for CmdStan using \code{\link[=write_stan_json]{write_stan_json()}}. See
\code{\link[=write_stan_json]{write_stan_json()}} for details on the conversions performed on \R objects
before they are passed to Stan.
\item A path to a data file compatible with CmdStan (JSON or \R dump). See the
appendices in the CmdStan guide for details on using these formats.
\item \code{NULL} or an empty list if the Stan program has no data block.
}}

\item{seed}{(positive integer(s)) A seed for the (P)RNG to pass to CmdStan.
In the case of multi-chain sampling the single \code{seed} will automatically be
augmented by the the run (chain) ID so that each chain uses a different
seed. The exception is the transformed data block, which defaults to using
same seed for all chains so that the same data is generated for all chains
if RNG functions are used. The only time \code{seed} should be specified as a
vector (one element per chain) is if RNG functions are used in transformed
data and the goal is to generate \emph{different} data for each chain.}

\item{refresh}{(non-negative integer) The number of iterations between
printed screen updates. If \code{refresh = 0}, only error messages will be
printed.}

\item{init}{(multiple options) The initialization method to use for the
variables declared in the parameters block of the Stan program. One of the
following:
\itemize{
\item A real number \code{x>0}. This initializes \emph{all} parameters randomly between
\verb{[-x,x]} on the \emph{unconstrained} parameter space.;
\item The number \code{0}. This initializes \emph{all} parameters to \code{0};
\item A character vector of paths (one per chain) to JSON or Rdump files
containing initial values for all or some parameters. See
\code{\link[=write_stan_json]{write_stan_json()}} to write \R objects to JSON files compatible with
CmdStan.
\item A list of lists containing initial values for all or some parameters. For
MCMC the list should contain a sublist for each chain. For other model
fitting methods there should be just one sublist. The sublists should have
named elements corresponding to the parameters for which you are specifying
initial values. See \strong{Examples}.
\item A function that returns a single list with names corresponding to the
parameters for which you are specifying initial values. The function can
take no arguments or a single argument \code{chain_id}. For MCMC, if the
function has argument \code{chain_id} it will be supplied with the chain id
(from 1 to number of chains) when called to generate the initial values.
See
\strong{Examples}.
\item A \code{\link{CmdStanMCMC}}, \code{\link{CmdStanMLE}}, \code{\link{CmdStanVB}}, \code{\link{CmdStanPathfinder}},
or \code{\link{CmdStanLaplace}} fit object.
If the fit object's parameters are only a subset of the model
parameters then the other parameters will be drawn by Stan's default
initialization. The fit object must have at least some parameters that are the
same name and dimensions as the current Stan model. For the \code{sample} and
\code{pathfinder} method, if the fit object has fewer draws than the requested
number of chains/paths then the inits will be drawn using sampling with
replacement. Otherwise sampling without replacement will be used.
When a \code{\link{CmdStanPathfinder}} fit object is used as the init, if
. \code{psis_resample} was set to \code{FALSE} and \code{calculate_lp} was
set to \code{TRUE} (default), then resampling without replacement with Pareto
smoothed weights will be used. If \code{psis_resample} was set to \code{TRUE} or
\code{calculate_lp} was set to \code{FALSE} then sampling without replacement with
uniform weights will be used to select the draws.
PSIS resampling is used to select the draws for  \code{\link{CmdStanVB}},
and \code{\link{CmdStanLaplace}} fit objects.
\item A type inheriting from \code{posterior::draws}. If the draws object has less
samples than the number of requested chains/paths then the inits will be
drawn using sampling with replacement. Otherwise sampling without
replacement will be used. If the draws object's parameters are only a subset
of the model parameters then the other parameters will be drawn by Stan's
default initialization. The fit object must have at least some parameters
that are the same name and dimensions as the current Stan model.
}}

\item{save_latent_dynamics}{(logical) Should auxiliary diagnostic information
about the latent dynamics be written to temporary diagnostic CSV files?
This argument replaces CmdStan's \code{diagnostic_file} argument and the content
written to CSV is controlled by the user's CmdStan installation and not
CmdStanR (for some algorithms no content may be written). The default is
\code{FALSE}, which is appropriate for almost every use case. To save the
temporary files created when \code{save_latent_dynamics=TRUE} see the
\code{\link[=fit-method-save_latent_dynamics_files]{$save_latent_dynamics_files()}}
method.}

\item{output_dir}{(string) A path to a directory where CmdStan should write
its output CSV files. For MCMC there will be one file per chain; for other
methods there will be a single file. For interactive use this can typically
be left at \code{NULL} (temporary directory) since CmdStanR makes the CmdStan
output (posterior draws and diagnostics) available in \R via methods of the
fitted model objects. This can be set for an entire \R session using
\code{options(cmdstanr_output_dir)}. The behavior of \code{output_dir} is as follows:
\itemize{
\item If \code{NULL} (the default), then the CSV files are written to a temporary
directory and only saved permanently if the user calls one of the \verb{$save_*}
methods of the fitted model object (e.g.,
\code{\link[=fit-method-save_output_files]{$save_output_files()}}). These temporary
files are removed when the fitted model object is \link[base:gc]{garbage collected} (manually or automatically).
\item If a path, then the files are created in \code{output_dir} with names
corresponding to the defaults used by \verb{$save_output_files()}.
}}

\item{output_basename}{(string) A string to use as a prefix for the names of
the output CSV files of CmdStan. If \code{NULL} (the default), the basename of
the output CSV files will be comprised from the model name, timestamp, and
5 random characters.}

\item{sig_figs}{(positive integer) The number of significant figures used
when storing the output values. By default, CmdStan represent the output
values with 6 significant figures. The upper limit for \code{sig_figs} is 18.
Increasing this value will result in larger output CSV files and thus an
increased usage of disk space.}

\item{opencl_ids}{(integer vector of length 2) The platform and device IDs of
the OpenCL device to use for fitting. The model must be compiled with
\code{cpp_options = list(stan_opencl = TRUE)} for this argument to have an
effect.}

\item{num_threads}{(positive integer) If the model was
\link[=model-method-compile]{compiled} with threading support, the number of
threads to use in parallelized sections (e.g., for multi-path pathfinder
as well as \code{reduce_sum}).}

\item{init_alpha}{(positive real) The initial step size parameter.}

\item{tol_obj}{(positive real) Convergence tolerance on changes in objective function value.}

\item{tol_rel_obj}{(positive real) Convergence tolerance on relative changes in objective function value.}

\item{tol_grad}{(positive real) Convergence tolerance on the norm of the gradient.}

\item{tol_rel_grad}{(positive real) Convergence tolerance on the relative norm of the gradient.}

\item{tol_param}{(positive real) Convergence tolerance on changes in parameter value.}

\item{history_size}{(positive integer) The size of the history used when
approximating the Hessian.}

\item{single_path_draws}{(positive integer) Number of draws a single
pathfinder should return. The number of draws PSIS sampling samples from
will be equal to \code{single_path_draws * num_paths}.}

\item{draws}{(positive integer) Number of draws to return after performing
pareto smooted importance sampling (PSIS). This should be smaller than
\code{single_path_draws * num_paths} (future versions of CmdStan will throw a
warning).}

\item{num_paths}{(positive integer) Number of single pathfinders to run.}

\item{max_lbfgs_iters}{(positive integer) The maximum number of iterations
for LBFGS.}

\item{num_elbo_draws}{(positive integer) Number of draws to make when
calculating the ELBO of the approximation at each iteration of LBFGS.}

\item{save_single_paths}{(logical) Whether to save the results of single
pathfinder runs in multi-pathfinder.}

\item{psis_resample}{(logical) Whether to perform pareto smoothed importance sampling.
If \code{TRUE}, the number of draws returned will be equal to \code{draws}.
If \code{FALSE}, the number of draws returned will be equal to \code{single_path_draws * num_paths}.}

\item{calculate_lp}{(logical) Whether to calculate the log probability of the draws.
If \code{TRUE}, the log probability will be calculated and given in the output.
If \code{FALSE}, the log probability will only be returned for draws used to determine the
ELBO in the pathfinder steps. All other draws will have a log probability of \code{NA}.
A value of \code{FALSE} will also turn off pareto smoothed importance sampling as the
lp calculation is needed for PSIS.}

\item{show_messages}{(logical) When \code{TRUE} (the default), prints all output
during the execution process, such as iteration numbers and elapsed times.
If the output is silenced then the \code{\link[=fit-method-output]{$output()}} method
of the resulting fit object can be used to display the silenced messages.}

\item{show_exceptions}{(logical) When \code{TRUE} (the default), prints all
informational messages, for example rejection of the current proposal.
Disable if you wish to silence these messages, but this is not usually
recommended unless you are very confident that the model is correct up to
numerical error. If the messages are silenced then the
\code{\link[=fit-method-output]{$output()}} method of the resulting fit object can be
used to display the silenced messages.}

\item{save_cmdstan_config}{(logical) When \code{TRUE} (the default), call CmdStan
with argument \code{"output save_config=1"} to save a json file which contains
the argument tree and extra information (equivalent to the output CSV file
header). This option is only available in CmdStan 2.34.0 and later.}

\description{
The \verb{$pathfinder()} method of a \code{\link{CmdStanModel}} object runs
Stan's Pathfinder algorithms. Pathfinder is a variational method for
approximately sampling from differentiable log densities. Starting from a
random initialization, Pathfinder locates normal approximations
to the target density along a quasi-Newton optimization path in
the unconstrained space, with local covariance estimated using
the negative inverse Hessian estimates produced by the LBFGS
optimizer. Pathfinder selects the normal approximation with the
lowest estimated Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to the true
posterior. Finally Pathfinder draws from that normal
approximation and returns the draws transformed to the
constrained scale. See the
\href{https://mc-stan.org/docs/cmdstan-guide/}{CmdStan User’s Guide}
for more details.

Any argument left as \code{NULL} will default to the default value used by the
installed version of CmdStan
