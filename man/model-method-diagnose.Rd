\usage{
diagnose_method(
  data = NULL,
  seed = NULL,
  init = NULL,
  output_dir = NULL,
  output_basename = NULL,
  epsilon = NULL,
  error = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{(multiple options) The data to use for the variables specified in
the data block of the Stan program. One of the following:
\itemize{
\item A named list of \R objects with the names corresponding to variables
declared in the data block of the Stan program. Internally this list is then
written to JSON for CmdStan using \code{\link[=write_stan_json]{write_stan_json()}}. See
\code{\link[=write_stan_json]{write_stan_json()}} for details on the conversions performed on \R objects
before they are passed to Stan.
\item A path to a data file compatible with CmdStan (JSON or \R dump). See the
appendices in the CmdStan manual for details on using these formats.
\item \code{NULL} or an empty list if the Stan program has no data block.
}}

\item{seed}{(positive integer(s)) A seed for the (P)RNG to pass to CmdStan.
In the case of multi-chain sampling the single \code{seed} will automatically be
augmented by the the run (chain) ID so that each chain uses a different
seed. The exception is the transformed data block, which defaults to
using same seed for all chains so that the same data is generated for all
chains if RNG functions are used. The only time \code{seed} should be specified
as a vector (one element per chain) is if RNG functions are used in
transformed data and the goal is to generate \emph{different} data for each
chain.}

\item{init}{(multiple options) The initialization method to use for the
variables declared in the parameters block of the Stan program:
\itemize{
\item A real number \code{x>0}. This initializes \emph{all} parameters randomly between
\verb{[-x,x]} (on the \emph{unconstrained} parameter space);
\item The number \code{0}. This initializes \emph{all} parameters to \code{0};
\item A character vector of paths (one per chain) to JSON or Rdump files
containing initial values for all or some parameters. See
\code{\link[=write_stan_json]{write_stan_json()}} to write \R objects to JSON files compatible with
CmdStan.
\item A list of lists containing initial values for all or some parameters. For
MCMC the list should contain a sublist for each chain. For optimization and
variational inference there should be just one sublist. The sublists should
have named elements corresponding to the parameters for which you are
specifying initial values. See \strong{Examples}.
\item A function that returns a single list with names corresponding to the
parameters for which you are specifying initial values. The function can
take no arguments or a single argument \code{chain_id}. For MCMC, if the function
has argument \code{chain_id} it will be supplied with the chain id (from 1 to
number of chains) when called to generate the initial values. See
\strong{Examples}.
}}

\item{output_dir}{(string) A path to a directory where CmdStan should write
its output CSV files. For interactive use this can typically be left at
\code{NULL} (temporary directory) since CmdStanR makes the CmdStan output
(posterior draws and diagnostics) available in \R via methods of the fitted
model objects. The behavior of \code{output_dir} is as follows:
\itemize{
\item If \code{NULL} (the default), then the CSV files are written to a temporary
directory and only saved permanently if the user calls one of the \verb{$save_*}
methods of the fitted model object (e.g.,
\code{\link[=fit-method-save_output_files]{$save_output_files()}}). These temporary
files are removed when the fitted model object is
\link[base:gc]{garbage collected} (manually or automatically).
\item If a path, then the files are created in \code{output_dir} with names
corresponding to the defaults used by \verb{$save_output_files()}.
}}

\item{output_basename}{(string) A string to use as a prefix for the
names of the output CSV files of CmdStan.
\itemize{
\item If \code{NULL} (the default), the basename of the output CSV files
will be comprised from the model name, timestamp and 5 random characters.
}}

\item{epsilon}{(positive real) The finite difference step size. Default
value is 1e-6.}

\item{error}{(positive real)  The error threshold. Default value is 1e-6.}
}
\value{
A \code{\link{CmdStanDiagnose}} object.
}
\description{
The \verb{$diagnose()} method of a \code{\link{CmdStanModel}} object
runs Stan's basic diagnostic feature that will calculate the gradients
of the initial state and compare them with gradients calculated by
finite differences. Discrepancies between the two indicate that there is
a problem with the model or initial states or else there is a bug in Stan.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
test <- cmdstanr_example("logistic", method = "diagnose")

# retrieve the gradients
test$gradients()
}
