\title{Run Stan's MCMC algorithms}
\description{
The \code{$sample()} method of a \code{\link{CmdStanModel}} object runs the
default MCMC algorithm in CmdStan (\code{algorithm=hmc engine=nuts}), to produce
a set of draws from the posterior distribution of a model conditioned on
some data.

\section{Arguments shared by all fitting methods}{
 The following arguments can
be specified for any of the fitting methods (\code{sample}, \code{optimize},
\code{variational}). Arguments left at \code{NULL} default to the default used by the
installed version of CmdStan.
\itemize{
\item \code{data}: (multiple options) The data to use. One of the following:
\itemize{
\item A named list of \R objects (like for RStan). Internally this list is
then written to JSON for CmdStan using \code{\link[=write_stan_json]{write_stan_json()}}.
\item A path to a data file compatible with CmdStan (JSON or \R dump). See
the appendices in the CmdStan manual for details on using these formats.
}
\item \code{seed}: (positive integer) A seed for the (P)RNG to pass to CmdStan.
\item \code{refresh}: (non-negative integer) The number of iterations between
screen updates.
\item \code{init}: (multiple options) The initialization method:
\itemize{
\item A real number \code{x>0} initializes randomly between \code{[-x,x]} (on the
\emph{unconstrained} parameter space);
\item \code{0} initializes to \code{0};
\item A character vector of paths (one per chain) to JSON or Rdump files. See
\code{\link[=write_stan_json]{write_stan_json()}} to write \R objects to JSON files compatible with
CmdStan.
}
\item \code{save_diagnostics}: (logical) Should auxiliary diagnostic information
(beyond standard diagnostics) be written to temporary diagnostic CSV files?
This argument replaces CmdStan's \code{diagnostic_file} argument and the content
written to CSV is controlled by the user's CmdStan installation and not
CmdStanR (and for some algorithms no content may be written). The default
is \code{save_diagnostics=FALSE}, which is appropriate for almost every use case
(all diagnostics recommended for users to check are \emph{always} saved, e.g.,
divergences for HMC). To save the temporary files created when
\code{save_diagnostics=TRUE} see the
\code{\link[=fit-method-save_diagnostic_files]{$save_diagnostic_files()}} method.
}
}

\section{Arguments unique to the \code{sample} method}{
 In addition to the
arguments above, the \code{$sample()} method also has its own set of arguments.

The following arguments are offered by CmdStanR but not CmdStan:
\itemize{
\item \code{num_chains}: (positive integer) The number of Markov chains to run.
Currently the chains are run sequentially, but the option to
execute CmdStan runs in parallel is coming soon.
This argument does not correspond to an argument in CmdStan because all
CmdStan arguments pertain to the execution of a single run only.
}

The rest of the arguments correspond to arguments offered by CmdStan. They
are described briefly here and in greater detail in the CmdStan manual.
Arguments left at \code{NULL} default to the default used by the installed
version of CmdStan.
\itemize{
\item \code{num_samples}: (positive integer) The number of post-warmup iterations to
run per chain.
\item \code{num_warmup}: (positive integer) The number of warmup iterations to run
per chain.
\item \code{save_warmup}: (logical) Should warmup iterations be saved? The default
is \code{FALSE}.
\item \code{thin}: (positive integer) The period between saved samples. This should
typically be left at its default (no thinning).
\item \code{max_depth}: (positive integer) The maximum allowed tree depth for the
NUTS engine. See the \emph{Tree Depth} section of the CmdStan manual for more
details.
\item \code{adapt_engaged}: (logical) Do warmup adaptation? The default is \code{TRUE}.
If a precomputed inverse metric is specified via the \code{inv_metric} argument
(or \code{metric_file}) then, if \code{adapt_engaged=TRUE}, Stan will use the
provided inverse metric just as an initial guess during adaptation. To turn
off adaptation when using a precomputed inverse metric set
\code{adapt_engaged=FALSE}.
\item \code{adapt_delta}: (real in \code{(0,1)}) The adaptation target acceptance
statistic.
\item \code{stepsize}: (positive real) The \emph{initial} step size for the discrete
approximation to continuous Hamiltonian dynamics. This is further tuned
during warmup.
\item \code{metric}: (character) One of \code{"diag_e"}, \code{"dense_e"}, or \code{"unit_e"},
specifying the geometry of the base manifold. See the \emph{Euclidean Metric}
section of the CmdStan documentation for more details. To specify a
precomputed (inverse) metric, see the \code{inv_metric} argument below.
\item \code{metric_file}: (character) A character vector containing paths to JSON or
Rdump file files (one per chain) compatible with CmdStan that contain
precomputed inverse metrics. The \code{metric_file} argument is inherited from
CmdStan but is confusing in that the entry in JSON or Rdump file(s) must be
named \code{inv_metric}, referring to the \emph{inverse} metric. We recommend instead
using CmdStanR's \code{inv_metric} argument (see below) to specify an inverse
metric directly using a vector or matrix from your \R session.
\item \code{inv_metric}: (vector, matrix) A vector (if \code{metric='diag_e'}) or a
matrix (if \code{metric='dense_e'}) for initializing the inverse metric, which
can be used as an alternative to the \code{metric_file} argument. A vector is
interpreted as a diagonal metric. The inverse metric is usually set to an
estimate of the posterior covariance. See the \code{adapt_engaged} argument
above for details (and control over) on how specifying a precomputed
inverse metric interacts with adaptation.
\item \code{init_buffer}: (non-negative integer) Width of initial fast timestep
adaptation interval during warmup.
\item \code{term_buffer}: (non-negative integer) Width of final fast timestep
adaptation interval during warmup.
\item \code{window}: (non-negative integer) Initial width of slow timestep/metric
adaptation interval.
