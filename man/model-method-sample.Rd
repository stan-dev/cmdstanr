\title{Run Stan's MCMC algorithms}
\description{
The \code{$sample()} method of a \code{\link{CmdStanModel}} object runs the
default MCMC algorithm in CmdStan (\code{algorithm=hmc engine=nuts}), to produce
a set of draws from the posterior distribution of a model conditioned on
some data.
}
\section{Usage}{
\preformatted{$sample(
  data = NULL,
  seed = NULL,
  refresh = NULL,
  init = NULL,
  save_diagnostics = FALSE,
  num_chains = NULL,
  # num_cores = NULL, # not yet implemented
  num_warmup = NULL,
  num_samples = NULL,
  save_warmup = FALSE,
  thin = NULL,
  max_depth = NULL,
  metric = NULL,
  stepsize = NULL,
  adapt_engaged = TRUE,
  adapt_delta = NULL
)
}
}

\section{Arguments shared by all fitting methods}{
 The following arguments can
be specified for any of the fitting methods (\code{sample}, \code{optimize},
\code{variational}). Arguments left at \code{NULL} default to the default used by the
installed version of CmdStan.
\itemize{
\item \code{data}: (multiple options) The data to use. One of the following:
\itemize{
\item A named list of \R objects (like for RStan). Internally this list is
then written to JSON for CmdStan using \code{\link[=write_stan_json]{write_stan_json()}}.
\item A path to a data file compatible with CmdStan (JSON or \R dump). See
the appendices in the CmdStan manual for details on using these formats.
}
\item \code{seed}: (positive integer) A seed for the (P)RNG to pass to CmdStan.
\item \code{refresh}: (non-negative integer) The number of iterations between
screen updates.
\item \code{init}: (multiple options) The initialization method:
\itemize{
\item A real number \code{x>0} initializes randomly between \code{[-x,x]} (on the
\emph{unconstrained} parameter space);
\item \code{0} initializes to \code{0};
\item A character vector of data file paths (one per chain) to
initialization files.
}
\item \code{save_diagnostics}: (logical) Should auxiliary diagnostic information
(beyond standard diagnostics) be written to temporary diagnostic CSV files?
This argument replaces CmdStan's \code{diagnostic_file} argument and the content
written to CSV is controlled by the user's CmdStan installation and not
CmdStanR (and for some algorithms no content may be written). The default
is \code{save_diagnostics=FALSE}, which is appropriate for almost every use case
(all diagnostics recommended for users to check are \emph{always} saved, e.g.,
divergences for HMC). To save the temporary files created when
\code{save_diagnostics=TRUE} see the
\code{\link[=fit-method-save_diagnostic_files]{$save_diagnostic_files()}} method.
}
}

\section{Arguments unique to the \code{sample} method}{
 In addition to the
arguments above, the \code{$sample()} method also has its own set of arguments.

The following arguments are offered by CmdStanR but not CmdStan:
\itemize{
\item \code{num_chains}: (positive integer) The number of Markov chains to run.
Currently the chains are run sequentially, but the option to
execute CmdStan runs in parallel is coming soon.
This argument does not correspond to an argument in CmdStan because all
CmdStan arguments pertain to the execution of a single run only.
}

The rest of the arguments correspond to arguments offered by CmdStan. They
are described briefly here and in greater detail in the CmdStan manual.
Arguments left at \code{NULL} default to the default used by the installed
version of CmdStan.
\itemize{
\item \code{num_samples}: (positive integer) The number of post-warmup iterations to
run per chain.
\item \code{num_warmup}: (positive integer) The number of warmup iterations to run
per chain.
\item \code{save_warmup}: (logical) Should warmup iterations be saved? The default
is \code{FALSE}.
\item \code{thin}: (positive integer) The period between saved samples. This should
typically be left at its default (no thinning).
\item \code{adapt_engaged}: (logical) Do warmup adaptation?
\item \code{adapt_delta}: (real in \code{(0,1)}) The adaptation target acceptance
statistic.
\item \code{stepsize}: (positive real) The \emph{initial} step size for the discrete
approximation to continuous Hamiltonian dynamics. This is further tuned
during warmup.
\item \code{metric}: (character) The geometry of the base manifold. See the
\emph{Euclidean Metric} section of the CmdStan documentation for more details.
One of the following:
\itemize{
\item A single string from among \code{"diag_e"}, \code{"dense_e"}, \code{"unit_e"}.
\item A character vector containing paths to files (one per chain) compatible
with CmdStan that contain precomputed metrics. Each path must be to a
JSON or Rdump file that contains an entry \code{inv_metric} whose value is
either the diagonal vector or the full covariance matrix. If
\code{adapt_engaged=TRUE}, Stan will use the provided metric just as an
initial guess during adaptation. To turn off adaptation when using a
precomputed metric set \code{adapt_engaged=FALSE}.
}
\item \code{max_depth}: (positive integer) The maximum allowed tree depth for the
NUTS engine. See the \emph{Tree Depth} section of the CmdStan manual for more
details.
}
}

\section{Value}{
 The \code{$sample()} method returns a \code{\link{CmdStanMCMC}} object.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Set path to cmdstan
# (Note: if you installed CmdStan via install_cmdstan() with default settings
# then setting the path is unnecessary but the default below should still work.
# Otherwise use the `path` argument to specify the location of your
# CmdStan installation.)

set_cmdstan_path(path = NULL)

# Create a CmdStanModel object from a Stan program,
# here using the example model that comes with CmdStan
stan_program <- file.path(cmdstan_path(), "examples/bernoulli/bernoulli.stan")

# specifying data as a named list (like RStan)
standata <- list(N = 10, y =c(0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1))
fit_mcmc <- mod$sample(data = standata, seed = 123, num_chains = 2)
