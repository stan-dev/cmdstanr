Description: A lightweight interface to 'Stan' <https://mc-stan.org>.
    The 'CmdStanR' interface is an alternative to 'RStan' that calls the command
    line interface for compilation and running algorithms instead of interfacing
    with C++ via 'Rcpp'. This has many benefits including always being compatible
    with the latest version of Stan, fewer installation errors, fewer unexpected
    crashes in RStudio, and a more permissive license.
